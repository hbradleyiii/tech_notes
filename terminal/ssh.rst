Rescue Frozen Bash from disconnected SSH session
------------------------------------------------

When an SSH session is disconnected for whatever reason, sometimes bash will
freeze. Bash can be unfozen by sending the SSH escape sequence which by default
is: ``~``.

The escape sequence can be sent by pressing: ``<Enter>``, ``~``, and then ``.``.
